## How do I submit my project file/code? :detective:

- Enter the appropriate repository matching your code sample

- Fork the repository first before proceeding

- Clone the forked repository to your local machine by using the `` git clone`` command

- Head on to the forked repository if using remote access or the cloned repository if making changes from your local machine.

- Make sure to avoid making changes to **main branch** by switching to  **submissions branch**. Use ``git switch submissions`` or ``git checkout submissions`` to switch to the submission branch first

- Navigate to submissions folder in the repository under the **submissions branch**

- Create a new folder inside **submissions** folder with your *Matriculation Number* as the folder name Example: (Folder name): ENG1503XXXX 

- Place all related codes in this personally created folder

- Commit and Push your works and updates to the submission branch you've been working on

- When finally done, create a PR with the title "**submission**" after correctly checking everything on the PR template
